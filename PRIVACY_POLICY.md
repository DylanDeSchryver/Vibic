# Vibic Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 2025

Vibic ("the App") is designed with your privacy as a priority.

## Data Collection

Vibic does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our own servers.

## Local Storage

All of your data is stored locally on your device, including:

- Imported audio files (music you choose to add)
- Track metadata (title/artist/album), artwork, playlists, and queue state
- App preferences (theme, playback settings, equalizer settings, lyrics settings)

We do not operate any backend servers for Vibic.

## Third-Party Services

Vibic does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.

However, the App can connect to third-party services when you use certain features:

- **YouTube** (via embedded playback in a web view) — used only when you stream content from the Search feature.
  - Vibic may send search queries and video identifiers to retrieve results and load playback.
  - YouTube/Google may collect information as described in their own privacy policy.
- **Lyrics services** — used to fetch lyrics when available:
  - **LRCLIB** (lrclib.net)
  - **lyrics.ovh** (api.lyrics.ovh)
  - Vibic may send track title/artist text to request lyrics.
- **ShazamKit (Apple)** — used only when you tap the music recognition button.
  - Vibic uses the microphone to capture audio for song identification.
  - Audio is used for recognition and is not stored by Vibic.
  - Apple’s processing of recognition requests is governed by Apple’s policies.

These services may have their own privacy policies. Vibic only sends the minimum information needed to perform the requested feature.

## Microphone Access

Microphone access is optional and only used for music recognition (ShazamKit) when you explicitly start recognition.

## File Access

Vibic only accesses files that you explicitly choose to import into the app. The App does not access any other files on your device.

## Children’s Privacy

Vibic does not knowingly collect personal information from any users, including children.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL.
